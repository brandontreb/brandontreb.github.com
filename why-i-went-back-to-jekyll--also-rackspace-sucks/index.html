<div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I was pretty humbled when a post of mine titled <a href="http://brandontreb.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-and-back-again/">WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again</a> made it to the front page of Hacker News.  I was a little down on Jekyll for the reasons listed in that post and was feeling pretty good about my Wordpress install.</p>

<p>At the time, I was running my own virtual instance on Rackspace cloud hosting (we&#8217;ll get to this momentarily).  I also had all of the caching and optimization plugins installed and welcomed the Hacker News traffic.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the influx of HN traffic crashed the server multiple times and I was (with good reason) mocked in the comments (&#8220;must be because he&#8217;s &#8216;back to Wordpress&#8217;&#8221;). So, I asked for advice and further &#8220;beefed up&#8221; my setup switching from Apache to Nginx, upping the ram, and switching caching plugins.  Wordpress is a beast and hard to optimize.  That&#8217;s not even the kicker as to why I switched away.</p>

<h4>A Call From Rackspace&#8230;</h4>

<p>About a month ago, I realized my blog was down.  I figured that it might have been that I was featured somewhere else which was crashing it (again I was rolling my eyes at Wordpress).  But then, I got a call and email from a <em>very</em> helpful Rackspace employee. The email went like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite the very best efforts of or our Engineering and Datacenter Operations Teams, unfortunately  the host machine that your cloud server &#8216;Websites&#8217; resides on was not able to be recovered.  At this point, we are looking at complete data loss.</p></blockquote>

<p>and&#8230; Rackspace, in this poorly phrased email, was basically like. &#8220;Well, sucks to be you, hope you had a backup!&#8221;. Well, I admit this is partially my fault for not having a backup as I am a bit of a n00b when it comes to server admin, but I had been hosting for years on (don&#8217;t judge me) GoDaddy before that and a couple years on Rackspace.  I had no idea that hosting companies didn&#8217;t have backups of their own.  It would seem that this might be crucial to their business.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I lost everything including a jewelry site that I ran (not many sales), an iPhone leaderboard site (not very popular), 2 of my buddies Wordpress blogs, and my current Wordpress blog.</p>

<h4>Jekyll To The Rescue</h4>

<p>I was pretty angry at Rackspace and myself for never making a backup, but then it hit me that <em>most</em> of my posts had been converted to Jekyll and were backed up in a github repository. I was able to restore my blog within a few minutes (now hosted on GitHub) and recover the Wordpress posts from the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">Feedburner cache</a> of my site.</p>

<p>As for my buddies&#8217; sites&#8230; I feel for them :(</p>

<h4>New List Of Why Jekyll Is Awesome</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Automatically backed up</strong> - This is huge. If not for switching to Jekyll at one point, I would have lost <strong>years</strong> worth of content. If you have every tried to back up Wordpress, it&#8217;s a huge frackin pain since the database dump usually gets HUGE.</li>
<li><strong>Free To Host</strong> - I&#8217;m not sure why I was so stubborn about doing my own hosting.  I am now hosting on <a href="https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com">GitHub</a> and it couldn&#8217;t be more stable and fast.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Blogging</strong> - This was my largest gripe about Jekyll. I was jealous that I couldn&#8217;t blog from my iPhone like Wordpress users. Well, I have found a pretty decent solution (tutorial to follow), which involves a combo of Prompt, Screen, and Vim.</li>
<li><strong>Content Oriented</strong> - Wordpress makes it super easy to dump tons of images into your posts.  While blogging with Jekyll (inside of Vim in my case), it&#8217;s a little bit more of a pain to add your own images.  That being said you must be choosy forcing you to focus more on the content and less on using visual crutches.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Anywhere</strong> - This was another limitation I was placing on Jekyll in my last post.  However, I just wasn&#8217;t using Jekyll to its full potential.  I was building my site locally and rsyncing it up to my server.  This process was a little tedious and discouraged me from writing many new posts.  Now, hosting with github, posting is as simple as a quick push to the repo.</li>
<li><strong>Ninja Fast</strong> - This one should be obvious.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I am quite happy blogging with Jekyll. As far as I&#8217;m concerned there is no reason to ever host my own blog again (as long as Github doesn&#8217;t ditch pages ;) ).  Also, if you currently have stuff on Rackspace, <strong>go make a backup now</strong> (or ditch them altogether).  Thanks for reading and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">look out</a> for my next post about mobile blogging with Jekyll.</p>

<p>Happy Blogging!</p>
