<p>As many of you may know, I created a site called <a href="http://freshapps.com">Fresh Apps</a>.  This site started as sort of a Digg for developer submitted iPhone apps.  Since then, we have added plenty of new features and have grown a community of over 10,000 iPhone users.</p>

<p>Recently, I have noticed a few services sprout up that basically have a schedule of apps that shift from paid to free for a given day.  The most notable being <a href="http://freeappaday.com">Free App A Day</a>.</p>

<p>After doing some research, sites such as these are charging a significant amount of money (I have heard up to $10,000) for a 1 day feature.</p>

<p>So, I was curious, given our user base, what do you (fellow iOS) developers think of FreshApps offering a similar service? If we did offer a similar service, here are some questions I have (and would love your feedback).</p>

<ol>
    <li>How would you change existing services? What new features would you like to see? what features are worthless?</li>
    <li>How much would you pay for such a feature?</li>
    <li>Would you be interested in having your app featured the first month for a minimal cost ($1 or so)?</li>
    <li>Would you use an iPhone app that lists the upcoming paid to free apps?</li>
</ol>


<p>Thank you all so much for your feedback.  I&#8217;m just in the brainstorming time of this, but I will totally keep you up to date if anything comes of it.</p>

<p>After setting up a blog site for the pastor of my church (<a href="http://brownbishop.com">http://brownbishop.com</a>), I fell in love with the<a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302"> Standard Wordpress Theme</a>.  Not only is the theme absolutely beautiful out of the box, it&#8217;s also a theme framework giving you TONS of configuration options including custom layouts, social network integration, and analytics integration.  I have seen quite a few amazing blogs built on top of the Standard Theme framework that all look incredible but completely different.</p>

<p>So, I urge you to <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302">check it out</a>, It&#8217;s kind of pricey ($50), but well worth worth it in my opinion.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For this blog post, I decided to take a small break from my <a href="http://brandontreb.com/creating-a-twitter-client-for-osx-%E2%80%93-part-3-publishing-tweets/">Twitter Client for Mac</a> tutorial series and discuss something a little more useful ;) .  I felt that a fitness post would be most appropriate around this time of year as all of our &#8220;Geek Guts&#8221; begin expanding.</p>

<h4>My Fitness Story</h4>


<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/geek-gut.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1306" title="geek-gut" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/geek-gut.png" alt="" width="256" height="352" /></a>It&#8217;s December 23rd and as we gear up for Christmas, we are also compiling our New Year&#8217;s resolutions.  And I&#8217;m sure that on most people&#8217;s (especially us computer geeks) lists is something related to weight and a healthy lifestyle.  So, I wanted to discuss a little bit about how I made fitness a priority in 2010 and how you can too in 2011.</p>

<p>I began my fitness journey at the beginning of 2010 where I weighed in at 185 lbs and had 19% body fat.  Now, I am in not way saying that I was a thick dude.  I have been blessed with a stellar metabolism, but I definitely didn&#8217;t look &#8220;in shape&#8221;.  More importantly I didn&#8217;t have a clue about living a healthy life style.  Being a geek, I sat for hours at my desk every day, eating quick foods and drinking soda.</p>

<p>One night, I saw a commercial for the fitness program P90X and was actually very intrigued.  Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not including any affiliate links or things of that sort, so please don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m trying to sell you on something.  Needless to say, I went on YouTube to find out just how legit this program was.  After some browsing, I was quite impressed and inspired.  It seemed that after 3 short months (seriously no time), people had changed their entire life around in terms of health and fitness.</p>

<p>So, I did what any geek would do and took a visit to the <em>Bay</em> and acquired a copy from some <em>Pirates</em>.  After checking out the program for a week or so, I was hooked and decided to go legit and purchase a copy.  Within 3 months, I began to absolutely LOVE exercising, in fact I became a little addicted to it :/ . I learned how to track what foods I was intaking as well as replaced much of the crappy liquids I was drinking with water.</p>

<p>After completion of the program, I was down to 163lbs with a 12% body fat and have been exercising since. I&#8217;m not posting photos because I feel that would be in bad taste.  Check out others on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=p90x&amp;aq=f">YouTube</a>.</p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>


<p>Now, this is a really lengthy intro (kind of sounds spammy too, sorry), but the point is, it&#8217;s not hard to get into a healthy routine.  I have talked to tons of people about my &#8220;transformation&#8221; (I hate this term), and almost every person asks me how I got started.  Everyone either feels that it&#8217;s too late for them, or they will start &#8216;tomorrow&#8217;.  So, here is a formula for you lazy geeks (I can call you that because that&#8217;s what I was last year :))</p>

<ol>
    <li>Grab a copy of P90X. Again, I&#8217;m not a P90X salesmen, Pirate a copy if you have to.  Just get one!  If you want to buy it, it&#8217;s about the cost of 3 months of the gym, which coincidentally is the length of the program (90 days) $120</li>
    <li>Buy a resistance band - These are everywhere (target, walmart, big 5, etc&#8230;) - $20</li>
    <li>Buy a pull-up bar - $30</li>
    <li>Quit stalling - Start this Monday and let me know how it goes :)</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, this is just the beginning.  The biggest problem with diets/fitness programs/etc is people don&#8217;t look at them as a lifestyle change, they see them as temporary.  People say crap like &#8220;I want to be XYZlbs or fit into a size J&#8221;.  Don&#8217;t do that! Sure these are nice goals to have, but DONT MAKE THEM THE REASON YOU EXERCISE AND EAT HEALTHY.  If you do, you are just setting yourself up to fail.  Exercise and don&#8217;t eat crap because you want to be healthy.  Do it because you are sick of being tired and lethargic all the time.</p>

<h4>I don&#8217;t have time to exercise</h4>


<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dali-clock.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1308" title="dali-clock" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dali-clock.jpeg" alt="" width="196" height="196" /></a>Of course you would say that&#8230; I did too.  That&#8217;s why I love P90X. It&#8217;s only 1 hour a day and within that hour, you are told exactly what to do.  I always felt that to exercise, I had to spend hours in the gym, running, lifting, blah blah&#8230; No, one hour a day.  I spend that reading Reddit.  Get up an hour earlier, go to bed an hour later.  Stop eating on your lunch break and exercise then.  You can always eat at your desk when you get back.</p>

<h4>Staying Motivated</h4>


<p>So, you have decided that 2011 is going to be your year; you are going to get in shape.  Here are a few tips to help you stay motivated.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Learn, learn, learn - Just as you spend time learning about new programming languages, or reading about yet another tablet device.  Learn about new things to eat, new exercises to try, new goals.  Whatever, just maintain the excitement by learning new things.</li>
    <li>Get others involved - This generally comes naturally.  When others see you getting into shape, they will most likely want to join.  This can be a great motivator, especially when you are feeling burnt out.  Get a workout buddy to go to the gym, run, do P90x, etc&#8230; with.</li>
    <li>Find healthy things to consume that don&#8217;t suck - This is a huge challenge for people starting out.  They think that they have to eat celery and chicken breasts all day.  This is one thing I love about p90x.  It comes with an incredibly (and delicious) diet plan including recipes. In a future post, I&#8217;m going to write about a stellar protein smoothie that I have every day.</li>
    <li>Get the crap out of your house - I&#8217;m serious, you won&#8217;t miss it. Cookies, Soda, Doughnuts, whatever&#8230;</li>
    <li>If you want soda, drink a soda - A can of soda is roughly 120 calories, this isn&#8217;t terrible.  But don&#8217;t make it a habbit.  Limit yourself and throw away your effin Big Gulp cup!</li>
    <li>Eat before you leave your house - this is huge.  If you are hungry and you are out, what do you do? You go scoop up a McFeeces from McDonalds&#8230; Instead, eat some lunch meat or whatever before you go run those errands.</li>
    <li>Eat frequently with smaller portions - I told my dad that I eat about  5-7 times a day, and he responded with &#8220;you&#8217;re going to get fat doing that&#8221;  Contrary to popular belief, it is far better for you to eat more frequent, smaller meals.  This is tricky when you spend the day in the office.  You have to somewhat plan your day in terms of food. Bring stuff to snack on such as nuts, popcorn, protein bars, and beef jerkey.</li>
    <li>Share your success - Blog, Tweet, Facebook, Youtube.  Whatever it is, tell people about it.  Others will surely praise you for this, and you will most likely motivate them. Plus, it will hold you accountable.</li>
    <li>Get a good water bottle and take it everywhere - Water is a tricky thing.  It&#8217;s so hard to remember to drink enough.  I have found that if I have water in front of me, I will always sip on it, especially when I&#8217;m sitting at my desk all day.</li>
</ol>


<p>To wrap this up, I&#8217;m not trying to sell you on P90X or any other fitness program.  I just feel that it will be a killer start and give you all of the tools needed to launch into a healthier, more fit 2011.  Also, you will start seeing results very quickly.</p>

<p>My wife has this interesting problem of having vivid dreams about whatever she was last watching/discussing before bed.  Last night, I was explaining to her all about memory leaks as I had a discussion with a coworker earlier in the day about them.  She was curious, so I gave her a very simple explanation in which she could understand.</p>

<p>Later in the night (about 3 am), my son woke up screaming.  He must have had a bad dream or something; so, I went in there, put him down and went back to bed.  My wife rolls over, looks me straight in the eye and says in a groggy voice &#8220;Does he have a memory leak?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed so hard it woke her up.  I then appropriately responded with &#8220;I have to go take a memory leak&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to part 3 of my #iDevblogaday series about creating a Twitter client for OSX</p>

<p>Now that we have some of our UI built, we need to add a key feature to our Twitter client: The ability to write and publish a tweet.  We will be adding a textbox that the user can type their tweet into along with a live character counter to ensure the character length does not go beyond 140 characters.  Finally, we will be using  MGTwitterEngine to publish the tweet to Twitter.</p>

<p>In case you didn&#8217;t read it,<a href="http://brandontreb.com/creating-a-twitter-client-for-osx-part-2-displaying-tweets/"> here is a link</a> to the previous tutorial in this series.  We will be using the interface created in it as a basis for this tutorial.</p>

<h4>Updating and Preparing Our Code</h4>


<p>Before we jump into the new stuff, I want to back up for a second and do some simple refactoring.  In our last tutorial, we just loaded the new tweets when our application fired up.  That&#8217;s great and all, but it&#8217;s not reusable.  So, we need to make a class property for our MGTwitterEngine and a method that we can call to refresh the tweets.  This will also come in handy later when we implement an auto refresh feature.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start by updating our header file TweetsController.h</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='objc'>#import 

@class MGTwitterEngine;

@interface TweetsController : NSViewController{
    IBOutlet NSTableView *tableView;
    NSMutableArray *tweets;
    MGTwitterEngine *twitterEngine;
}

@property (retain) IBOutlet NSTableView *tableView;
@property (retain) NSMutableArray *tweets;
@property (retain) MGTwitterEngine *twitterEngine;

- (void) refreshTweets;

@end</code></pre>
</div>


<p>As you can see we have added a few things.  First, at the top we see a forward class declaration for our MGTwitterEngine.  If you recall, forward class declarations are to combat circular imports. Here is a snippet from the objective-c documentation about forward class declarations.</p>

<blockquote>The @class directive minimizes the amount of code seen by the compiler and linker, and is therefore the simplest way to give a forward declaration of a class name. Being simple, it avoids potential problems that may come with importing files that import still other files. For example, if one class declares a statically typed instance variable of another class, and their two interface files import each other, neither class may compile correctly.</blockquote>


<p>Next, we create a property called twitterEngine.  It goes without saying by now that you should synthesize this property and release it in your .m file.  I&#8217;m not going to show that code.  Finally, we declare a method called refreshTweets.  This will be the method we will call to when we want to refresh the list of tweets.  At some point we will alter this method to take an additional argument that will allow us to differentiate between timeline, replies, and messages.  For now, we will stick with timeline.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at the updates in the .m file.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='objc'>.
.
.
- (void)awakeFromNib {
    self.tweets = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    OAToken *token = [[OAToken alloc] initWithKey:@&quot;&quot;
                                      secret:@&quot;&quot;];;

    // Put your Twitter username and password here:
    NSString *username = @&quot;brandontreb&quot;;
    NSString *consumerKey = @&quot;&quot;;
    NSString *consumerSecret = @&quot;&quot;;

    // Create a TwitterEngine and set our login details.
    self.twitterEngine = [[[MGTwitterEngine alloc] initWithDelegate:self] autorelease];
    [twitterEngine setUsesSecureConnection:NO];
    [twitterEngine setConsumerKey:consumerKey secret:consumerSecret];
    [twitterEngine setUsername:username];
    [twitterEngine setAccessToken:token];
    [self refreshTweets];
}

- (void) refreshTweets {
    [twitterEngine getHomeTimelineSinceID:0 startingAtPage:0 count:20];
}
.
.
.</code></pre>
</div>


<p>So, nothing really new here, we are just moving the scope of our twitter engine out of the awakeFromNib method and creating a reusable way to grab the user&#8217;s timeline.  We are now ready to declare our IBOutlets and IBActions for our interface.</p>

<h4>Setting Up IBOutlets and IBActions</h4>


<p>Two additional IBOutlets will need to be set up for our Twitter client.  The first is an NSTextView in which the user will by composing their Tweet in to.  And the other is an NSTextField that is not editable.  This will essentially be a label that displays the number of remaining characters to the user.</p>

<p>In addition to the IBOutlets, we need an IBAction that responds when the user clicks the Tweet button.</p>

<p>Our TweetsController.h header file should now look like this.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='objc'>#import 

@class MGTwitterEngine;

@interface TweetsController : NSViewController{
    IBOutlet NSTableView *tableView;
    IBOutlet NSTextView *tweetTextView;
    IBOutlet NSTextField *tweetCountLabel;
    NSMutableArray *tweets;
    MGTwitterEngine *twitterEngine;
}

@property (retain) IBOutlet NSTableView *tableView;
@property (retain) IBOutlet NSTextView *tweetTextView;
@property (retain) IBOutlet NSTextField *tweetCountLabel;
@property (retain) NSMutableArray *tweets;
@property (retain) MGTwitterEngine *twitterEngine;

- (void) refreshTweets;
- (IBAction) tweetButtonClicked:(id) sender;

@end</code></pre>
</div>


<p>One other thing  that I failed to mention above is we tell our class to implement the NSTextViewDelegate protocol.  This will allow us to have a live counter of the characters being entered in our text view.</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s work on the interface&#8230;</p>

<h4>Updating The Interface</h4>


<p>Open up MainMenu.xib and drag an NSTextView, Label, and Button on to your view resizing as necessary. Your interface should now look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-16-at-1.26.02-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1172" title="Screen shot 2010-12-16 at 1.26.02 PM" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-16-at-1.26.02-PM.png" alt="" width="423" height="517" /></a></p>

<p>Make sure that you click on the NSTextView that you added and uncheck the box that says &#8220;show vertical scroller&#8221;.  Also, drag from the text view to TweetsController to set the delegate.  I found that I had to expand the view tree to get at the TextView as in the screenshot below:</p>

<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-16-at-1.42.02-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1177" title="Screen shot 2010-12-16 at 1.42.02 PM" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-16-at-1.42.02-PM.png" alt="" width="439" height="372" /></a></p>

<p>Next, click on  TweetsController in the explorer window and hook up each of the 2 IBOutlets.  Here is a screenshot of the explorer window and the Connections window with the connections made.</p>

<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-16-at-1.27.44-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1173" title="Screen shot 2010-12-16 at 1.27.44 PM" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-16-at-1.27.44-PM.png" alt="" width="472" height="209" /></a></p>

<p>Also, you will want to control-click and drag from your button to the TweetsController to hook it up to your tweetButtonClicked IBAction.</p>

<p>You can now close Interface Builder and jump back to the code&#8230;</p>

<h4>Implementing Live Character Counting</h4>


<p>This process is actually pretty simple.  We just need to implement one delegate method of our NSTextView.  Open TweetsController.m and add the following method:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='objc'>- (BOOL)textView:(NSTextView *)aTextView
   shouldChangeTextInRange:(NSRange)affectedCharRange
   replacementString:(NSString *)replacementString {
    NSString *text = [tweetTextView string];
    int length = [text length] + 1;
    [tweetCountLabel setStringValue:[NSString stringWithFormat:@&quot;%d&quot;,(140 - length)]];
    // Allows user to delete characters
    if([replacementString length] == 0) return YES;
    return length &amp;lt; 140;
}</code></pre>
</div>


<p>The shouldChangeTextInRange delegate method gets called every time the user types a character.  We first check the length of the string currently in the box.   1 is added to it since we are looking at adding a potential character.  Next, we update our character label to 140-(length of current string).  Following that is a line to check if the replacement string is 0.  This is needed for when the user presses backspace and they have already entered 140 characters.  The final line will only return true if the character count in the text box is less than 140, otherwise it will prevent the user from typing anything else.</p>

<h4>Publishing The Tweet To Twitter</h4>


<p>Our final step is to actually publish the tweet to Twitter and update the timeline.  We need to implement the tweetButtonClicked method and update the statusesReceived delegate method.  So in, TweetsController.m, update to the following code:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='objc'>- (IBAction) tweetButtonClicked:(id) sender {
    [twitterEngine sendUpdate:[tweetTextView string]];
    [tweetTextView setString:@&quot;&quot;];
}

#pragma mark -
#pragma mark MGTwitterEngineDelegate
- (void)statusesReceived:(NSArray *)statuses forRequest:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier {

    if([statuses count] == 1) { // when user updates their status
        NSDictionary *tweetDict = [statuses objectAtIndex:0];
        NSString *screenName = [[tweetDict objectForKey:@&quot;user&quot;] objectForKey:@&quot;screen_name&quot;];
        NSString *text = [tweetDict objectForKey:@&quot;text&quot;];
        Tweet *tweet = [[Tweet alloc] init];
        tweet.screenName = screenName;
        tweet.text = text;
        [self.tweets insertObject:tweet atIndex:0];
        [tweet release];
    } else {
        for(NSDictionary *tweetDict in statuses) {
            NSString *screenName = [[tweetDict objectForKey:@&quot;user&quot;] objectForKey:@&quot;screen_name&quot;];
            NSString *text = [tweetDict objectForKey:@&quot;text&quot;];
            Tweet *tweet = [[Tweet alloc] init];
            tweet.screenName = screenName;
            tweet.text = text;
            [self.tweets addObject:tweet];
            [tweet release];
        }
    }

    [self.tableView performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(reloadData) withObject:nil waitUntilDone:NO];
}</code></pre>
</div>


<p>First, we see the implementation of our IBAction.  It simply calls one of our super handy methods in MGTwitterEngine.  The sendUpdate method, will asynchronously update your Twitter status and post back to the statusesReceived method with YOUR status info.  After that, we clear the text box that the user typed into.</p>

<p>The statusReceived method gets updated because we need to handle things differently when the user updates their status verses when we are pulling down the timeline.  If there is only one status (ie the user just posted), we want to push it on to the head of the tweets array.  We do this so that it displays at the top of our client as the timeline that comes down from Twitter is ordered from newest to oldest.  Other than that, there are no major changes to this method.</p>

<p>After building and running, your client should now look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-16-at-1.54.56-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1178" title="Screen shot 2010-12-16 at 1.54.56 PM" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-16-at-1.54.56-PM.png" alt="" width="423" height="517" /></a></p>

<p>Well, that about does it for today.  I hope you have enjoyed this one.  If you have any comments or questions, feel free to leave them here. You can even write them to me using your new &#8220;fancy&#8221; Twitter client to <a href="http://twitter.com/brandontreb">@brandontreb</a>.</p>

<p>I found this article while browsing reddit and was blown away.  I have been a little mystified at the potential algorithms used by notch to render the terrain in Minecraft.</p>

<p>This provides a killer explanation of some interesting algorithms that can be used to generate such worlds.  It also contains the source code that you can download and play with.</p>
