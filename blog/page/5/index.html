  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is a continuation from my previous post <a href="/my-journey-to-create-the-inpulsenotifier-for-jailbroken-iphones-part-1/">found here</a>.</p>

<h4>A MobileSubstrate Tweak?</h4>

<p>After I completed a basic app that allowed me to send various notification types from my iPhone to my inPulse watch, I quickly realized that this would not work if I wanted to hook into the iPhone&#8217;s notification system.  A Google search revealed to me that I had to make MobileSubstrate hack to overwrite the default notification functionally.</p>

<p><b> What the heck is Mobile Substrate? </b></p>

<p>Here is the description according to <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/MobileSubstrate">iPhoneDevWiki.net</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>MobileSubstrate is the de facto framework that allows 3rd-party developers to provide run-time
patches (“MobileSubstrate extensions”) to system functions, similar to Application Enhancer on
the OS X. MobileSubstrate consists of 3 major components: MobileHooker, MobileLoader and safe mode.</p></blockquote>

<p>Basically, it allows you to &#8220;hook&#8221; into any method of any class on the iPhone.  I will talk in a later tutorial about how to see what methods are available.  Here is a sample for hooking into the CFShow() method:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='objc'>static void (*original_CFShow)(CFTypeRef obj);  // a function pointer to store the original CFShow().
void replaced_CFShow(CFTypeRef obj) {           // our replacement of CFShow().
  printf(&quot;Calling original CFShow(%p)...&quot;, obj);
  original_CFShow(obj);                         // calls the original CFShow.
  printf(&quot; done.\n&quot;);
}
...
// hook CFShow to our own implementation.
MSHookFunction(CFShow, replaced_CFShow, &amp;original_CFShow);
// From now on any call to CFShow will pass through replaced_CFShow first.
...
CFShow(CFSTR(&quot;test&quot;));</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Yeah&#8230; this looks pretty intense.  Luckily, I found a super helpful tool that greatly simplifies this process called <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started">theos</a>.  Check out my <a href="/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-getting-the-tools/">tutorial on getting started with theos</a>.</p>

<p>What lead me to theos was the incredible work of <a href="http://www.peterhajas.com/">Peter Hajas</a>.  He wrote and <a href="https://github.com/peterhajas/MobileNotifier">open sourced</a> his fantastic notifications app called Mobile Notifier.  Without it, I would have been dead in the water.  After chatting downloading his code and nagging him on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/peterhajas">Twitter</a>, he pointed me to theos.</p>

<h4>Working With theos</h4>

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-getting-the-tools/">my tutorial</a>, theos is a great tool to aid in the development of a Mobile Substrate Tweak.  Instead of the complexities above to hook into the functionality of classes, you simply do something like this:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='objc'>%hook SpringBoard

-(void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(id)application
{    
    %orig;

    INPreferenceManager *preferenceManager = [[[INPreferenceManager alloc] init] autorelease];
    BOOL enabled = [[preferenceManager.preferences valueForKey:@&quot;inpulseEnabled&quot;] boolValue];
    if(enabled) {
        manager = [[INAlertManager alloc] init];
        [manager connectToWatch];
    }
}

- (void) dealloc {
    [manager release];
    manager = nil;
    %orig;
}

%end;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This is a simple hook that allows me to overwrite the functionality of Springboard&#8217;s applicationDidFinishLaunching method.  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dhowett">DHowett</a> (creator of theos), has done a brilliant job giving devs quite a few commands like %orig (which calls the original method) and %hook (starts a hook).</p>

<p>The reason this works is, the file you code in (called Tweaks.xm) gets run through a preprocessor called Logos (which he also wrote).  It replaces these simple commands with the complex stuff you see above before compiling your project.  Using this technique, you can hook into anything.  I will have a tutorial on this in the very near future, so make sure you <a href="feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">subscribe to my RSS feed</a> if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>

<h4>Copy And Paste</h4>

<p>OK, so I copied some of Peter&#8217;s code (he&#8217;s well cited in the source and I kept his license in the headers too).  He had already solved the problem of capturing most of the iPhone&#8217;s notifications and this is precisely what I needed.  So I Frankensteined my code and his to create the first version of <a href="https://github.com/brandontreb/inPulseNotifier">inPulseNotifier</a>.</p>

<p>This current version supports SMS, Push Notifications, Local Notifications, and Calendar Notifications.</p>

<h4>Deployment</h4>

<p>Even though I open sourced the code for the app, I couldn&#8217;t possibly expect users to build the code themselves and install it on their devices.  So I had to learn about setting up my own Cydia repository.</p>

<p>A Cydia repository allows users to browse your applications/tweaks through the Cydia application <a href="http://www.saurik.com/">created by Saurik</a>. This is the method of choice for deploying jailbroken iPhone applications.</p>

<p>Saurik has a very detailed tutorial on creating a Cydia repository <a href="http://www.saurik.com/id/7">here</a>.</p>

<p>(In case you are wondering, my Cydia repo is hosted at <a href="http://brandontreb.com/cydia">http://brandontreb.com/cydia</a> )</p>

<h4>OK, How Do I Install It?</h4>

<p>Great question I assume you might ask.  I have written a tutorial about installing it on your iPhone <a href="http://www.getinpulse.com/hack/forum/viewtopic.php?p=545#p545">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Plans For The Future</h4>

<p>Well, at the moment development has slowed as I prepare for a few changes in my life.  However, in the coming months, I intend on doing the following updates.</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the dependency on Insomnia for preventing the phone from sleeping.  I have found a version of their source that I can integrate into my own code.</li>
<li>Add support for phone calls</li>
<li>Add support for emails</li>
<li>Create an SBSettings toggle to allow rapid enabling/disabling</li>
<li>Auto-reconnect after disconnecting from the watch</li>
</ol>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Hacking for the inPulse watch has been a new and exciting experience.  The team over there has really created something special and I can&#8217;t wait to see what the future holds for them (hopefully a touchscreen).</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts in the comments. And <a href="feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">stay tuned</a> for some jailbroken dev tutorials based on my experiences.</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of you may have seen my tweets or blog posts regarding my development of a native iOS interface for the <a href="http://getinpulse.com">inPulse Watch</a>.  I just wanted to share a bit with you about the development process and talk about my updates moving forward.</p>

<h4>What is the inPulse Watch?</h4>

<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, the inPulse watch is a programmable wristwatch with a bluetooth controller.  It can run a single app at a time on top of it&#8217;s firmware that is installed on the watch via a bluetooth interface with your computer.  People have written all sorts of apps from analog clocks to roguelikes and Connway&#8217;s Game of Life.  Check out <a href="http://inpulsewatch.com/watchapps.asp">http://inpulsewatch.com/watchapps.asp</a> to see the latest apps.</p>

<div style="clear:both">&nbsp</div>


<p></p>

<h4>It Begins</h4>

<p>After waiting about 10 days for my watch (yeah it&#8217;s a long waiting period since they have seen quite a bit of recent success), it finally came in the mail.  Enthusiastically, I opened it up and followed their <a href="http://www.getinpulse.com/guide/">getting started guide</a>. Within a few minutes I was running some of the sample applications in the forums.</p>

<h4>No iOS Support?</h4>

<p>One of the coolest features of the watch is the ability to have your smartphone notifications show up on it.  You are able to read SMS, Email, Calendar, etc&#8230; for a wide variety of Blackberry and Android phones.</p>

<p>After digging around a bit, I was disappointed to see that there was limited (no) iPhone support.  They had some old file that used BTStack at some point to communicate a simple canned message to the iPhone. No documentation, no support, nada.</p>

<h4>Building The App</h4>

<p><img src="http://code.google.com/p/btstack/logo?cct=1278342571" style="float:left;margin:5px;"></p>

<p>As I had no experience developing for a jailbroken iPhone, I had no idea how to even compile this sample app.  So, I used the Google machine and found the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/btstack/">Google repository</a> for BTStack (the bluetooth library of choice for jailbroken iOS apps). I was able to download the source and build a sample application that basically connected my iPhone to a bluetooth device.</p>

<p>Well, this got me started.  So I did what any curious developer would do and started plugging crap in.  I replaced the sample file that was packaged with BTStack with a slightly modified version of inPulse&#8217;s sample iPhone file.  Sure enough, I was able to build and install it.</p>

<h4>We Have Connection</h4>

<p>After figuring out how to hardcode my watch&#8217;s address into the source, I was able to determine that the iPhone had actually connected to the watch.  I monitored the packets and threw up an alert view (No NSLogging available at this point) when a connection was made.</p>

<p>So, now that we are connected, let&#8217;s trying sending the sample message&#8230;fail!  I couldn&#8217;t even send the time.</p>

<p>At this point, I decided to move the code I had written into a sample iPhone project so that I could do attached debugging.  This showed me that the packets were arriving on the watch since I received an ack packet back.  So, the watch sees the messages, but doesn&#8217;t consider them notifications.</p>

<h4>Time to hit the docs</h4>

<p><img src="/img/post_images/2011/04/pulse_protocol.png" style="float:right">
Knowing that the packets were received gave me quite a bit of hope.  I figured that I must have had the protocol incorrect.  So, I dug into the inPulse protocol document which outlined what the packet structures should look like.  My C skills aren&#8217;t the strongest so I had to look up quite a few things.</p>

<p>Sure enough, they had upped the version number of their protocol by 1 and mine was outdated.  So, I updated what I could and gave it another shot&#8230;fail.</p>

<p>No messages were displaying.  At this point I was ready to give up.  I read online somewhere that the BT implementation on the watch was not supported by inPulse and felt dead in the water.  So I took a break for a couple days.</p>

<p>When I came back to it,  I was tapping through my watch and noticed that the calendar appointments had some data in them on the watch. Could it be? Did my notifications arrive? (I was trying to send SMS notifications).  So I dug into the docs again&#8230;</p>

<h4>We have a message!!!</h4>

<p><img src="/img/post_images/2011/04/hello_world.jpg" style="float:left;margin:10px;" width="200"></p>

<p>Sure enough, I had some fields declared as <i> uint16_t </i> when they should have been <i> uint8_t </i> .  My headers were the wrong size!!!  All of a sudden I was able to send every type of notification to the watch and have it displayed.</p>

<p>It was now time to build out an actual application for release to inPulse.  The next hurdle would be hooking into the iPhone&#8217;s messaging system and forwarding along the messages.  Now the real iPhone hacking begins.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Developing for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking">jailbroken</a> is actually quite similar to regular iOS development with one addition.  More Power! oh oh oh (said in a Tim Taylor voice (sorry for non-Americans that don&#8217;t get the reference)).  With your device jailbroken, you have the ability to hook in to pretty much every class that Apple writes allowing you quite a bit of control over the iPhone&#8217;s functionality.</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s tutorial, I will simply be discussing the best way to get up and running with the tools necessary to write a jailbroken iPhone app. We will not be doing any coding, however this tutorial will be necessary for all posts going forward.</p>

<p><b>Theos</b></p>

<p>There are many ways to go about writing a jailbroken iOS app.  Most of them are quite complex.  <a href="http://twitter.com/dhowett">@DHowett</a> has come up with a brilliant tool called <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started">theos</a> which drastically simplifies the process.  My tutorial will pretty much be a regurgitation of his tutorial <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started">found here</a> with some added cheesy jokes.</p>

<p>Theos is a command line utility that essentially generates a template for creating applications, libraries, preference bundles, tools, and mobile substrate hacks.  These cover 99% of the jailbroken apps that you are likely to create.</p>

<p>One thing to note is DHowett talks about doing jailbroken iOS development on both Mac and Linux; my tutorials will be Mac-only.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Install the iOS SDK</h4>

<p>You will first need to install the official iOS SDK.</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action</a></p>

<p>You can register for a free account and download the latest SDK.  Once installed reboot your Mac and come back here. I&#8217;ll wait&#8230;</p>

<h4>Step 2: Setting Up The Environment Variables</h4>

<p>Start by deciding on a good location to install theos.  The suggested location is <i>/opt/theos</i>.   The only issue with doing it here is you will need to have administrator permissions as well as have to enter your password when updating files.  For teaching purposes, I am going to assume you will install it here too.</p>

<p>Open the terminal and type:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>export THEOS=/opt/theos</code></pre>
</div>


<p>What we are doing is setting an environment variable.  You can always see if this variable is set by typing <i>echo $THEOS</i> in the command line.  It will need to be (re)set every time you reopen the terminal to develop a jailbroken app.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Getting theos</h4>

<p>DHowett uses subversion for version control on theos, so you need to make sure and have it installed.  If you followed step one above, it should have been installed by default.  We will be checking out theos into the THEOS directory specified in step 2.</p>

<p>In the terminal type:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>svn co http://svn.howett.net/svn/theos/trunk $THEOS</code></pre>
</div>


<p>You most likely will be asked for your password.  You should now see the <i>/opt/theos</i> directory created with theos installed.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Getting ldid</h4>

<p>We now need to install the ldid tool.  ldid is a tool written by <a href="http://www.saurik.com/">Saurik</a> (if you don&#8217;t know who he is, stop reading now).  Basically, it simulates the signing process for the iPhone, allowing you to install your jailbroken apps/hacks on an actual device.</p>

<p>You can find this tool in many places, however DHowett has generously hosted it for us on his dropbox account.</p>

<p>Now, I had a tricky time getting this to download directly to my <i>/opt/theos</i> folder.  So, I downloaded it to my desktop and then moved it in to <i>/opt/theos/bin/ldid</i></p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>curl -s http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3157793/ldid &gt; ~/Desktop/ldid
chmod +x ~/Desktop/ldid
mv ~/Desktop/ldid $THEOS/bin/ldid</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Alternatively, if you can get it to work properly, do it like DHowett suggests and download it directly into place.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>curl -s http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3157793/ldid &gt; $THEOS/bin/ldid; chmod +x $THEOS/bin/ldid</code></pre>
</div>


<h4>Step 5: Install dpkg</h4>

<p>Dpkg is a tool to bundle up your app into a Debian package for distribution in a Cydia repository. You can install it through Macports.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>sudo port install dpkg</code></pre>
</div>


<h4>Step 6: Creating A New Project</h4>

<p>theos uses a tool called nic (new instance creator) to create a new project.  Simply run nic by typing:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>$THEOS/bin/nic.pl</code></pre>
</div>


<p>and it starts the new instance creator.  Here is a sample of making a jailbroken application.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>brandon-trebitowskis-macbook-pro:Desktop brandontreb$ $THEOS/bin/nic.pl
NIC 1.0 - New Instance Creator
------------------------------
  [1.] iphone/application
  [2.] iphone/library
  [3.] iphone/preference_bundle
  [4.] iphone/tool
  [5.] iphone/tweak
Choose a Template (required): 1
Project Name (required): FartLight
Package Name [com.yourcompany.fartlight]: com.brandontreb.fartlight
Author/Maintainer Name [Brandon Trebitowski]: 
Instantiating iphone/application in fartlight/...
Done.</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This will create a new folder with a basic template called fartlight (killer project, I know).  In addition to the usual files it will contain a Makefile (for building the application) and a control file (information about the application when it&#8217;s in a Cydia repository).</p>

<p>This should now give you the basis for creating a jailbroken application/tweak/hack.  In the next tutorial we will go over building, signing, and deployment.  For now, you can check out the project I created with nic called <a href="https://github.com/brandontreb/inPulseNotifier">inPulseNotifier</a>.  It&#8217;s a combination of a tweak (5) and a preference bundle (3) for the app settings.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask me a question in the comments and check out #theos on IRC.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="alignright" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1574088/photo.JPG " title="iPulseNotifier app receiving a message from Twitter" width="150"></p>

<p>As of recent I have had a ton of interest in doing development for Jailbroken iPhones.  I love the power, being able to hack <i>anything</i> on the device.  It opens up a whole new world of possibilities.</p>

<p>My most current project (inPulseNotifier) is a Mobile Substrate hack which allows the iPhone to interface with an <a href="http://getinpulse.com">inPulse watch</a>.  It uses BTStack and boots up during the init method of your springboard.  I will do a full writeup on this in the near future, but basically it forwards all of your phone&#8217;s notifications (SMS, Local, Push, Calendar) to your watch!</p>

<h4>Serious Lack Of Resources</h4>

<p>InPulseNotifier was a blast to create, however I found it <b>incredibly</b> challenging to find many resources about doing jailbroken development.  I finally found <a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started">theos</a> which was a total lifesaver.  Also, I had the code for <a href="http://www.peterhajas.com/blog/2011/2/27/mobilenotifier-beta3-copious-corn-flakes-1.html">mobileNotifier</a> to follow along with.</p>

<p>IRC (yeah I&#8217;m a true hacker ;)) was also huge help, but there simply aren&#8217;t enough tutorials/examples on the web related to jailbroken iPhone dev.  My guesses are either 1. it&#8217;s quite hard, 2. there&#8217;s not enough <font color"green">$$$</font> in it, or 3. jailbreakers like to stay &#8220;underground&#8221;.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t quite figured it out, but I was curious what YOU thought about it as I&#8217;m considering doing some jailbroken iOS development tutorials on my blog.  Please let me know in the comments.  Are you down to &#8220;Hack the planet&#8221;?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I have finally made the switch from <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and couldn&#8217;t be happier.  Here are some of the bonuses I have seen thus far.</p>

<ol>
<li>SPEED: Just click around on my site.  It is screaming fast now.</li>
<li>Resources: Checking top on my server reveals that I have a TON of extra resources (which makes sense since Jekyll sites are way more lightweight).</li>
<li>Ease of blogging: Ok, Wordpress was  pretty easy too, however, I was really starting to get sick of the post interface.  I switch to Tumblr at some point simply for it&#8217;s minimalist interface.  Wordpress&#8217; is gross and TinyMCE (the WYSIWG editor) is terrible.  I love writing in TextMate!</li>
<li>Offline publishing.  I can write my posts anywhere since they are just .md (markdown) files.  Check out <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Daring Fireball&#8217;s</a> great writeup on this.</li>
<li>Portability: Have you have tried to move your Wordpress site?  Yeah, it&#8217;s about as fun as chewing on tin foil with metal fillings.</li>
<li>Focus on content: Wordpress has quite a bit of focus on using rich media in your posts which tends to take away from the content if you are not careful.  There is something about writing in a text editor that makes you forget about images/video/etc&#8230; unless it&#8217;s totally needed. So don&#8217;t be surprised if my posts aren&#8217;t as &#8220;rich&#8221;. (Hopefully they will be more clever :) )</li>
</ol>


<p>I really urge you to see for yourself what it&#8217;s like blogging with Jekyll.  I will do a writeup on my conversion process in the near future to help aid others in the switch.  Until then, you can google around and find tons of great resources.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, after my 6 year relationship with Wordpress, I have been having some strong feelings for another (blog engine).  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> does everything that I want my wordpress to do.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Not suck at security</li>
    <li>Not be bloated</li>
    <li>Not have a sucky post editor</li>
    <li>Expense - I have a few blogs hosted on Rackspace and my bill has gotten pretty pricey.  I&#8217;m hoping to host my Jekyll site on App Engine for frizzle (free).</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s about it.  In case you live in a box (which most of us do since most houses are relatively square) and haven&#8217;t hear of it, Jekyll is a new blogging engine written in Ruby.  Simply put, you write posts, run a command and it spits out static pages.  You just upload these pages to your server (how old skool right?)  Now you no longer have a dependancies on any server side language, fancy server configs, etc&#8230;</p>

<p>Jekyll has no(minimal) features, no comments, track backs etc&#8230; and no built-in SEO.  It doesn&#8217;t even have an admin (since you are serving up static content).  Sounds like a blast right? I&#8217;ll blog a bit about it as I make the migration and you will see, it&#8217;s going to be great!</p>

<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">this post</a> from Hacker News, which was pretty much the nail in the coffin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Perhaps this already exists, if so, please link me to it.</p>

<p><strong>The idea</strong>
Drop music into your Dropbox folder on your computer.  Then open up the app which presents you with an iPod like interface for this music.</p>

<p><strong>The genius</strong>
What&#8217;s great about it is, you have all of you music on your iPhone without using up disk space.  Of course you may need to upgrade your Dropbox account to something greater than 2GBs to see any real value.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My latest iOS app, Smart Lockscreen Creator has just released on iPhone for $.99.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/smart-lockscreen-creator/id419890996?mt=8">Download It Here</a></p>

<h4><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/smart-lockscreen-creator.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1448" title="smart-lockscreen-creator" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/smart-lockscreen-creator.jpeg" alt="" width="224" height="336" /></a>The Idea</h4>


<p>Currently your lockscreen on your iOS device is nothing more than a pretty watch with a background.  Jailbreakers have solved this issue with an incredible application called intelliscreen, which adds lots of interesting information to it.  However, you and I are Apple fanboys and won&#8217;t violate our precious iPhones with jailbreaking.  Enter Smart Lockscreen Creator.</p>

<p>Smart Lockscreen Creator allows you to build a completely custom (and smart) lockscreen image within the application.  You then set this image as your lockscreen background.  The following items are currently supported by the app.</p>

<ul>
<li>Current weather, condition, high and low for any city/region in the World</li>
<li>Weekly forecast for any city/region in the World</li>
<li>Monthly calendar</li>
<li>Custom text</li>
<li>Blank space (useful when customizing the look of your lockscreen)</li>
<li>Line separator</li>
<li>Many more in the works!</li>
</ul>


<p>Here are some promo codes.  If you fail to grab one and have some interest in reviewing the app on your site, I would be happy to email you one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="alignright" title="albuquerque-marathon" src="http://www.active.com/images/upimages/Logo554.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="288" />Well, I have finally decided to put my money where my mouth is when it comes to fitness and train up for a half marathon! The marathon I&#8217;m training for is the <a href="http://www.active.com/running/albuquerque-nm/albuquerque-half-marathon-2011">Albuquerque Half Marathon</a> on Saturday, April 16th at 8 am (that logo is such an eyesore).</p>

<p>Two months seems like a relatively short time to prepare, especially for my first &#8220;real&#8221; run, however I am just aiming to finish rather than being competitive.  Right now, I am running about 3-4 miles per day with a longer day of ~5 miles.  As the weeks pass, I intend on upping that to ~5 miles/day with a longer run at about 10 miles.</p>

<p>If any of you are training for something similar, I would love any advice, feedback, criticism, encouragement, stories, etc&#8230; that you have.  Just post em in the comments.</p>

<p>Also, for those of you who are on <strong>nike+</strong>, please befriend me.  My username is (you guessed it) <strong>brandontreb</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very excited about this goal and will be blogging along the way (amidst my other coding related posts of course).</p>

<p><strong>It&#8217;s a long road ahead ;)</strong></p>
