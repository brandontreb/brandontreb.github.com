    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I used to be an Emacs guy and would battle to the death on the war between Vim and Emacs.  It wasn't until a coworker of mine sat down and really showed me just how cool/simple/powerful Vim can be.  Just using Vim is a new adventure every day and has really improved my productivity.  I now use it to code, blog, and even jot down quick notes.</p>

<p>Last week, I saw on Hacker News a link announcing <a href="http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/">Vim has been ported to iOS</a>.  I have spent a week or so with it and can honestly say the port is almost perfect!</p>

<p><img src="http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/overview.jpg?13270539" width="400"></p>

<p>It has <em>most</em> of the major Vim features and commands including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatic indentation</li>
<li>Visual mode (block operations)</li>
<li>Language-aware syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Integrated scripting language that lets you extend functionalities</li>
<li>Macros recording and playback</li>
<li>Markers management (to quickly move around the edited file)</li>
<li>Multiple clipboards</li>
</ul>


<p>You even have access to the config file to remap keys and define your own custom macros.</p>

<p>There are a few features that would make this better on mobile however:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dropbox Support - Currently you must use iTunes to work with Vim documents on mobile. There needs to be an easier way to share these.</li>
<li>Keyboard bar - Since you have to switch modes so frequently and there are some keys you type often ( ":" ), it would be nice to have quick access to these.</li>
<li>Plugin support - This is an Apple limitation :(</li>
<li>NERDTree - The file browser that's built in doesn't work too well.</li>
</ol>


<p>With Vim mobile, you can now look <em>even more</em> nerdy on your iPhone ;)</p>
