    <id>http://brandontreb.github.com/why-you-should-check-out-unity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back, my buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/seantron">seantron</a> showed me some of his 3D games he'd been working on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hamsteria!/id470730689?mt=8">including this one</a>.  My initial reaction was "how the heck did he get the chopps to do that?".  While, Sean is an incredible developer with a ton of creativity, doing things like loading models, texture mapping, or even basic 3D projects are flippin hard.</p>

<p>A while back I <a href="http://brandontreb.com/ludum-dare-competition-week-2-update/">tried my hand at 3D</a> and made sort of a <em>basic</em> Minecraft style game from scratch using OpenGL ES. Let me tell you, it was brutal (and I have been coding for almost 10 years). This project took me a week or so to ramp up, get basic cubes and textures going and a simple first person view.</p>

<h4>Enter Unity</h4>

<p>Sean had mentioned to me that he used this 3D engine called Unity to create his games.  While I had tried XNA, I had never heard of Unity and figured it was similar (basically a framework with some convenience methods for loading models, mapping, etc...).  Boy was I wrong...</p>

<p>Unity 3D is more than just an engine. It is an application that allows even the most novice of developers to create beautiful, rich, 3D games. I'm serious.  Check out this demo below of an app I made in unity in about 3 hours using <a href="http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/unity/getting-started-with-unity/">this tutorial</a>.  The crazy part is, I wrote <em>almost</em> no code. Much of the interactions and game were developed using drag and drop and <strong>free</strong> assets.</p>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1574088/unity/tuts-plus/TutsPlus.html">Link to my awesome game</a></p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>I was very reluctant to learn Unity at first as the interface appears to be a bit daunting.  However, once you check out a few tutorials, it becomes second nature. Here are a few places to get started:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMWhtKjUr10">InfinitAmmo's Unity 3D tutorial series</a> - This was where I first began. He does a great job at going over the basics of Unity while keeping things interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/unity/getting-started-with-unity/">Getting Started With Unity on Active Tuts+</a> - This is where I made the game you checked out above. Take an hour and do the first in the series, you will be very surprised with the outcome.</p>

<p><a href="http://unity3d.com/support/resources/tutorials/">Unity 3D tutorials</a> - Unity has a wealth of information and demo projects on their website.  They come with the source and comprehensive PDFs detailing various aspects of each of their demo games.</p>

<p>After completing at least the top two series', you <em>should</em> have enough knowledge to begin hacking on a game of your own. I know that I do :)</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I hope this has been enlightening and I really urge you to check out Unity.</p>

    <id>http://brandontreb.github.com/whats-your-cruising-speed</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<center><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3i3A3o3o0M3O1I3G3K3M/2009-porsche-911-carrera-19_460x0w.jpg"></center>


<p>Earlier this year, I launched an application called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-lockscreen-creator/id419890996?mt=8">Smart Lockscreen Creator</a>.  It was a pretty simple app that allowed you to add dynamic data (such as weather) to your wallpaper and save it back out to your camera roll.  The idea is to improve the functionality of the user's lockscreen.  It did very well on launch (and even made it to #1 in the Israel App Store).  At the peak, I was selling about 600 copies per day.</p>

<p>Well, the honeymoon period is over and sales have slowed down <strong>quite a bit</strong>, however they have completely stabilized around what I'm calling the "cruising speed".  So, what's my speed?  On an average day, I will sell between 10-15 copies of the application per day.  This is with no additional marketing, I'm not on any top 500 pages, and honestly I haven't done much to the application at all.   The app even has ~2 star rating.  Not because it sucks, but because people don't read the description and assume it will constantly update their lockscreen.</p>

<p>I have asked a few developers and this seems to be a fairly common cruising speed.  So, now I'm asking you.</p>

<p><strong>What's YOUR cruising speed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you think updating the application will affect this speed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What dictates the speed?</strong></p>

<p>I'd love to hear your responses in the comments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img width="540" src="http://ios2011.voicesthatmatter.com/attachments/0002/0659/topright.gif"></p>

<p>In November, I will be attending the <a href="http://ios2011.voicesthatmatter.com/">Voices That Matter iOS Developers conference</a>.  It will be my third time attending, and I can't recommend it enough. One major change from this year however is, I will be attending as a sponsor.  A new company/project (currently in private alpha) will be participating as a sponsor at the conference.</p>

<p>We intend to have a table set up with multiple computers and devices so you can check out our product first hand.  Bleh, that sounds kind of spammy.  But, we have been working on something incredibly killer and I can't wait to share it with all of you.</p>

<p><strong>If YOU are planning on attending the conference</strong>, please comment on this post, <a href="http://twitter.com/brandontreb">write me on Twitter</a>, or email me.  I'd love to set up a one on one time to give you the full demo.</p>

<p>Also, I'm sure many of you already have a discount code, but if not, I have a pretty sweet promo code for $100!</p>

<h4>BSTBLOG</h4>

<p>Enter that at checkout.  Combining that with the "Early Bird Pricing", you save $300! Not a bad deal.</p>

<p>So, if you do end up coming (you are crazy not to), please communicate with me.  At least to say hi, you don't <em>have</em> to here my super awesome sales spiel if you don't want to...</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Beginning Jailbroken iOS Development - Your First Tweak]]></title>
    <link href="http://brandontreb.github.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-your-first-tweak/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-23T23:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandontreb.github.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-your-first-tweak</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the 3rd installment of my jailbroken iOS development series.  If you haven't already, make sure you read the following tutorials to get up to speed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://brandontreb.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-getting-the-tools/">Beginning Jailbroken iOS Development - Getting The Tools</a></li>
<li><a href="http://brandontreb.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-building-and-deployment/">Beginning Jailbroken iOS Development - Building And Deployment</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Today I'm going to show you how to patch any internal Apple method that you want.  In this demo, we are going to hook into the init method of Springboard and show a UIAlertView upon starting your phone up.  It's not the <em>coolest</em> of applications, but the design pattern and concepts used can be applied to patching any other internal method of any class.</p>

<h4>Getting Set Up</h4>

<p>In order to create a tweak, you must interface with Saurik's libsubstrate.dylib dynamic library.  This might come packaged with theos, but if not, you need to download a fresh copy. One can be found on this <strong>very spammy</strong> site. <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?2upm53uzzj0488u">Download libsubstrate.dylib</a></p>

<p>Once you have downloaded it, copy it to the folder /opt/theos/lib.  This is the folder where you will copy any other dynamic libraries that you might need to use in your application.</p>

<p><strong>The iOS Headers</strong></p>

<p>Most likely, theos came with the iOS headers that you need.  If not, you need to obtain them by doing a header dump on the device OR Googling around for them.  I suggest the latter as someone else has surely done the work for you.  Once you have these headers, you need to put them in the folder /opt/theos/include.  For this example you should have a folder in there called Springboard containing all of the Springboard headers.</p>

<h4>Creating The Project</h4>

<p>The process for creating the project is simple.  I'm going to assume that you already have all of your environment variables in place that we discussed in the <a href="http://brandontreb.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-building-and-deployment/">last tutorial</a>.  If not, you will get errors.</p>

<p>Open the console, cd into the directory where you want to create your application and type the following command to create a new Tweak application.</p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>$THEOS/bin/nic.pl</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>Now, when prompted select the number [5] for a tweak.  Next, you will enter all of the information about your project.  The resulting output should look like this:</p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;NIC 1.0 - New Instance Creator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  [1.] iphone/application
  [2.] iphone/library
  [3.] iphone/preference_bundle
  [4.] iphone/tool
  [5.] iphone/tweak
Choose a Template (required): 5
Project Name (required): WelcomeWagon
Package Name [com.yourcompany.welcomewagon]:               &lt;br/&gt;
Author/Maintainer Name [Brandon Trebitowski]:
MobileSubstrate Bundle filter [com.apple.springboard]:
Instantiating iphone/tweak in welcomewagon/...
Done.</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<h4>The Tweaks File</h4>

<p>Once your project has been created, you can open in up in your favorite editor.  I prefer TextMate.  Theos creates a file for you called Tweak.xm.  This is a special file that will run through theos's preprocessor in order to hook into the classes and methods that you specify.  So, rather than us having to write tons of boilerplate/crazy hook code, Theos does that all for us with a nice interface.</p>

<p>By default, EVERYTHING in that file is commented out.  It took me longer than I care to admit to figure that out when I created my first Jailbroken iOS app.</p>

<p><strong>The Preprocessor commands</strong></p>

<p>There are a few commands that you need to know in order to hook into a class:</p>

<p><strong>%hook and %end</strong></p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='objc'>%hook Springboard
// overwrite methods here
%end</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>The first command is called %hook followed by the name of the class you are hooking in to.  You choose the methods to overwrite within the context of %hook className and %end. In the above code, we are saying that we want to hook into some methods in the SpringBoard class.</p>

<p><strong>%orig</strong></p>

<p>When inside a method, the %orig command will call the original method.  You can even pass arguments to the command like this %orig(arg1,arg2).  One thing to note is, if you don't call %orig, the original method will never be called.  So, if you hook SpringBoard's init command and fail to call %orig, SpringBoard will never start and your phone will be unusable until you delete your app via ssh.</p>

<h4>Hooking Into Springboard</h4>

<p>Open up Tweak.xm and add the following code.  Don't worry, I will explain it afterwards.</p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='objc'>&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;import &amp;lt;SpringBoard/SpringBoard.h&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%hook SpringBoard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-(void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(id)application {&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;%orig;

UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@&quot;Welcome&quot; 
    message:@&quot;Welcome to your iPhone Brandon!&quot; 
    delegate:nil 
    cancelButtonTitle:@&quot;Thanks&quot; 
    otherButtonTitles:nil];
[alert show];
[alert release];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%end</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>OK, so what's going on here.  First, we import the Springboard.h header.  This will allow us access to springboard.  Next, we tell the preprocessor to hook into the Springboard class.</p>

<p>The method that we are overriding here is the applicationDidFinishLaunching: method.  This will of course fire right when SpringBoard starts up.  Notice that we make the %orig call.  If we omit this, our phone would never boot up properly as SpringBoard needs it's initialization method.</p>

<p>Finally, we just throw up a UIAlertView.  Again, not too exciting, but you get the point.</p>

<h4>Adding Additional Frameworks</h4>

<p>If you were to type build to build this project at this point you would see an error like this:</p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>Tweak.xm: In function ‘objc_object&lt;em&gt; $_ungrouped$SpringBoard$init(SpringBoard&lt;/em&gt;, objc_selector&lt;em&gt;)’:
Tweak.xm:6: error: declaration of ‘objc_object&lt;/em&gt; self’ shadows a parameter</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>This is because we depend on the UIKit framework to show alerts.  In order to tell theos that we want to link in UIKit, we must create an addition to the Makefile.  Add the following line to your Makefile.</p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>WelcomeWagon_FRAMEWORKS = UIKit</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>This will ensure that UIKit gets linked in.</p>

<h4>Building, Packaging, And Installing</h4>

<p>In the terminal, cd into your project's directory.  At this point, you can type make to simply build your project.  Theos has provided a nice way to automatically install your library on your device.  In order for it to work you must have the THEOS_DEVICE_IP environment variable set to your iPhone/iPod's IP address. This is explained in the <a href="http://brandontreb.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-building-and-deployment/">previous tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>In the terminal type:</p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>make install</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>This will build your tweak and install it on your device. When prompted to enter your password, the default is "alpine".  Also, make sure that SSH is installed on your device.</p>

<p>After installation, your device will respring and you will be greeted with your custom message like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3J1W0j0c1F3y081P2D2i/IMG_0001.PNG" alt="Jailbroken App Development" /></p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>You should now have a basic understand of how to patch any method inside of iOS.  With this knowledge, you can customize ANYTHING that you don't like about the device.  If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them in the comments section of this post.</p>

<p>You can download the source code for this tutorial <a href="http://cl.ly/1u0l0U0y2I0T1g2s3D0O">here</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Jailbreaking!</p>

    <link href="http://brandontreb.github.com/10-Great-Pixel-Art-Tutorial-And-Free-Resource-Sites-For-Your-Games/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-13T21:30:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://brandontreb.github.com/10-Great-Pixel-Art-Tutorial-And-Free-Resource-Sites-For-Your-Games</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don't usually create "list" posts, however I wanted to share a grouping of resources I have been collecting over the past few months.  As you may have noticed, I'm a bit of a Pixel Art fanatic and wanted to share with you the tutorials that helped to get me started as well as some sites offering some high quality <strong>free</strong> pixel art.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that some of these sites have similar content, however they all take a slightly different approach in teaching.  I found it very helpful to read each of the tutorials and learn from different points of view.</p>

<h4>1. Gas 13 - Isometric Pixel Art Tutorial</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/f9.gif" alt="Pixel House" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/isometric_pixelart_tutorial_mathematics_of_isometrics.php">link</a></p>

<p>This was my very first pixel art tutorial.  I was amazed at how quickly I was able to make a really professional looking pixel art building.  I highly recommend all of the tutorials on this guy's site.  Some of them however can be quite complex.</p>

<h4>2. Derek Yu - The Pixel Tutorial</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.derekyu.com/images/extras/lucha-finished.gif" alt="Wrestler" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.derekyu.com/?page_id=221">link</a></p>

<p>This was another site that I stumbled upon early on in my pixel art quest.  Derek provides a nice story telling approach to teaching the in's and out's of pixel art.  I really appreciated his tutorial on lines.</p>

<h4>3. Mini Wizard Studios - What is 'Isometric' pixel art</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.miniwizardstudios.com/images/pixel/iso/office.gif" alt="Sample pixel art" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.miniwizardstudios.com/iso.asp">link</a></p>

<p>This guy offers another dead simple intro to pixel art.  Most of it is just explanation, however his examples are quite good.  He shows examples of Backgrounds, Characters, objects, tiles, as well as a ton of different UI elements and icons. It's a great place to go for some inspiration.</p>

<h4>4. Hub Pages - How To Start With Pixel Art</h4>

<p><img src="http://s3.hubimg.com/u/1629662_f520.jpg" alt="Victorian House" /></p>

<p><a href="http://vanmall.hubpages.com/hub/How-To-Start-With-Pixel-Art">link</a></p>

<p>Again, another great site for the pixel art n00b.  This tutorial goes over all of the basics of line, cubes, and texturing.  It also links out to other great pixel art tutorials for creating various objects such as a bed, table, and lamp.</p>

<h4>5. Bio Rust - Isometric Pixel Art</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.biorust.com/tutorials/ps-isometricpixelart/Image-15a.jpg" alt="Pixel Sphere" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.biorust.com/tutorials/detail/247/us/">link</a></p>

<p>This tutorial is a bit rushed <em>however</em> it provides a great overview for creating other basic shapes besides a cube.  In addition to lines and cubes, it demonstrates pyramids, cylinders, and spheres.</p>

<h4>6. Oceans Dream - Pixel Art Tutorials</h4>

<p><img src="http://pixel.oceansdream.net/wp-content/uploads/pixel.oceansdream.net/2010/02/celsiusHair.png" alt="Pixel Character" /></p>

<p><a href="http://pixel.oceansdream.net/">link</a></p>

<p>This is the most comprehensive site for pixel art tutorials.  While many of them aren't for the faint of heart, there is some fantastic content here.  This site has everything from tips and tricks, to character creation, to breakdowns of existing games.  I could spend hours on this site.</p>

<h4>7. Pixel Character Tutorial - NekoSoraYagami on Deviant Art</h4>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/28162n1b1i1H0f03421d/Screen%20shot%202011-08-13%20at%209.38.11%20PM.png" alt="Pixel Character" /></p>

<p><a href="http://nekosorayagami.deviantart.com/art/Pixel-Character-Tutorial-76829227">link</a></p>

<p>This is a nice in depth tutorial for creating a custom character from start to finish.  They start out with a base character (plain, nude, genderless) and turn it into their own creation.  Very well written and very fun to follow.</p>

<h4>8. City Creator</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.citycreator.com/images/pages/home_card_1.gif" alt="City Creator" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.citycreator.com/">link</a></p>

<p>The City creator is not so much a tutorial as it is a resource for creating gorgeous pixel cities.  It has a nice interface and a <strong>huge</strong> selection of buildings, objects, roads, signs, and trees to go into your city.  I am not sure what their license is on the generated cities, however I didn't see any clause about not reusing the graphics in your own projects.</p>

<h4>9. Has Graphics</h4>
