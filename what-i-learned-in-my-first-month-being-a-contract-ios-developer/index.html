<div class="entry-content"><p><strong>tl;dr Present yourself to potential clients as if you have already made it. Don&#8217;t be scared, the work it out there. Freelancing FTW!1!</strong></p>

<p>In the first week of December, I got a rather unfortunate (and unexpected) call from the CEO of the company I was working for.  The gist of it was &#8220;we are reorganizing, and have decided to cut your position. Effective Immediately&#8221;.  At this point, I was the Director Of Mobile Engineering and was making a very decent salary.  While I was planning on leaving to go freelance at some point, I hadn&#8217;t dreamed it would be this sudden.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that CEO did me one of the biggest favors of my life.  He forced me to go indie.  I probably would have flailed there for at least another year before even considering moving on.</p>

<p>I want to share a few things (good and bad) about what I have learned in the past month and how I will never (willingly) work for a company again.</p>

<h2>Panic Sets In</h2>

<p>I had been working at the aforementioned company for the past 4 years.  In fact, it was my first job out of college.  So, you can imagine how scary and stressful it was going from a steady paycheck to nothing in the blink of an eye.  What&#8217;s ironic about this is, many people I have talked to since going indie have told me that they wish they could do it too, but really like the &#8220;security&#8221; of their corporate job.</p>

<p>At first, I freaked out a little and took the day off (I was &#8220;let go&#8221; in the morning).  But, the very next day I hit the ground running in search of a contract.</p>

<h2>Contracts, Contracts Everywhere</h2>

<p>Much to my surprise, there are contracting opportunities <strong>everywhere</strong>.  Again, I had to leave the company so soon, I hadn&#8217;t had time to research this myself beforehand.  A simple Google search of &#8220;[your field] contract work&#8221; should reveal plenty (assuming your field is some sort of software. I can&#8217;t speak for other industries).  I even started applying for salaried jobs as a contractor. You would be surprised how many companies are open to it.</p>

<p>This was immediately comforting.</p>

<h2>Talk The Talk</h2>

<p>My first few days of looking for a contract were pretty interesting.  Being that I had just been let go, I felt this intense pressure to land a contract right away.  This definitely came through in how I related to the recruiters and people I spoke with.  My good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/slcaruso">Scott Caruso</a> sat down with me and gave me some of the most important advice I would hear for dealing with potential clients.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are looking for the &#8220;right opportunity&#8221;.  If you are considering freelance, you obviously feel you are an expert (or close to) in your field and that definitely has value.  Don&#8217;t settle for crappy contracts at crappy rates just because you need the money.  You will hate life.</p></li>
<li><p>Spam! During my first week, I would contact one or two people and they said they would get back to me.  Well, I didn&#8217;t want to possibly have to tell them no later, so I would politely not communicate with anyone else until I heard back.  That was dumb.
Finding contracts is like shopping at Goodwill.  It&#8217;s mostly crap, but if you go through enough of the crap, you will find a gem.</p></li>
<li><p>Leverage your existing contacts. This should be obvious.  I was holding off on this early on as I didn&#8217;t want to sound lame.  However, these are the people you can show a little desperation to as they are (or should be) your friends.  That being said, someone always knows someone else that needs some work done. If I hadn&#8217;t done this, I for sure would have violated #1.</p></li>
<li><p>You are a scarce resource (at least present yourself that way):  Once I started telling recruiters that I was talking to tons of others and am planning on making a deal this week, I started getting a flood of them calling me back.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>The Bad</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Everything you do starts to get a price tag.  The other day, I asked my wife to <a href="http://xkcd.com/149/">make me a sandwichh</a>.  She told me to make it myself, and I politely informed her that the 15 minutes spent doing that would cost us $25 so it had better be the best sandwhich I have ever made.<br/>
I am not sure if this feeling ever goes away (if you are a veteran freelance, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts).</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s a little scary knowing you don&#8217;t have a paycheck in X months (X being your current contract length).  This was the most frightening thing at first.  Now, it seems like an exciting challenge.</p></li>
<li><p>Tendency to overwork: Since you now have money++ and can make more just by adding hours, you will be drawn to work more.  I have talked to many others who end up leaving freelance because of burnout from working too much.  Sure you made $30K in 2 weeks, but you are hating life.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So far my journey as an independent iOS developer has been incredible.  I am loving every minute of it and I encourage anyone interested in it to do the same.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s for the n00b or the non-self starter.  <a href="http://www.jamiebegin.com/how-to-become-a-successful-freelance-web-developer-and-not-kill-your-career/">This post</a> I found on Hacker News has a brilliant step by step tutorial on moving in this direction.</p>

<p>I hope you have enjoyed yet another post on freelancing.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
